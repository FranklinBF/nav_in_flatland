# nav_in_flatland

# What is this repository for?
Train DRL agents on ROS compatible simulations for autonomous navigation in highly dynamic environments. Flatland-DRL integration is based on Ronja Gueldenring's repo: drl_local_planner_ros_stable_baselines. Following features are included:

* Setup to train a local planner with reinforcement learning approaches from [stable baselines](https://github.com/hill-a/stable-baselines)

* Training in a simulator fusion of [Flatland](https://github.com/avidbots/flatland) and [pedsim_ros](https://github.com/srl-freiburg/pedsim_ros)

* Local planner has been trained on static and dynamic obstacles: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHvpO0hVnAg)
